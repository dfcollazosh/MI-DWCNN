# MI-DWCNN
CNN learner with an improved interpretation of the spatial neural patterns that mainly contribute to MI tasksâ€™ classifier accuracy. To better deal with EEG non stationarity, the bi-domain time-frequency representation is extracted using a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). For assessing spatial relevance in bi-domain time-frequency decoding of neural responses, we employ a Deep & Wide learning model that initially accomplishes 2D-Feature generation in the form of t-f topographic maps that are further fed to the discriminating CNN framework to select the input topograms that mostly contribute in terms of accuracy.
