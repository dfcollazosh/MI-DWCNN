# MI-DWCNN
CNN learner with an improved interpretation of the spatial neural patterns that mainly contribute to MI tasksâ€™ classifier accuracy. To better deal with EEG non67 stationarity, the bi-domain time-frequency representation is ex68 tracted using a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform 69 (CWT) and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). For assessing spa70 tial relevance in bi-domain time-frequency decoding of neu71 ral responses, we employ a Deep&amp;Wide learning model that 72 initially accomplishes 2D-Feature generation in the form of t-f topographic maps that are further fed to the discriminating CNN framework to select the input topograms that mostly contribute in terms of accuracy.
